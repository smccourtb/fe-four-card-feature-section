## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I had an issue with extra white space outside of body and html. Still not sure what it was about. After fiddling with some things it just sort of went away. I'm gonna try to get to the bottom of it and understand why it was happening to begin with.
